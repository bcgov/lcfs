  "description": "<p>The <b>effective date</b> assigned to a transaction determines which <b>compliance period</b> (calendar year) the compliance units can be applied to. To use compliance units during a <b>reporting period</b> (January 1 to March 31), transactions must be completed on or before March 31 following the compliance period. Compliance units purchased or received after March 31 can only be applied to future compliance period obligations.</p><p>The <b>available compliance unit balance</b> displays the units in an organization’s balance that can be applied to a compliance obligation in that compliance period. Compliance units that are pending the completion of a transaction or transfer are held in <b>reserve</b> and are not included in an organization’s available balance.</p><p>Available compliance units for a given compliance period include:<br />(1) credits generated from the supply of fuel in the compliance period and/or previous compliance periods; and<br />(2) credits issued under initiative agreements or acquired through transfers on or before the reporting deadline (March 31).</p><p>Example: credits issued under an initiative agreement with an effective date of March 15, 2024 can be used for compliance with the 2023 compliance period as well as any future compliance periods (e.g., 2024, 2025, etc.). Credits issued under an initiative agreement with an effective date of April 20, 2024 can only be used for compliance for the 2024 and future compliance periods (e.g., 2025, 2026, etc.).</p>",
