# lcfs

This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## Poetry

This project uses poetry. It's a modern dependency management
tool.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m lcfs
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about poetry here: https://python-poetry.org/

```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here.

All environment variables should start with "LCFS_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "lcfs/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "LCFS_RANDOM_PARAMETER"
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `lcfs.settings.Settings.Config`.

You can read more about BaseSettings class here: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

By default it runs:
* black (formats your code);
* mypy (validates types);
* isort (sorts imports in all files);
* flake8 (spots possibe bugs);

## Migrations

If you want to migrate your database, you should run following commands:
```bash
# To run all migrations until the migration with revision_id.
alembic upgrade "<revision_id>"

# To perform all pending migrations.
alembic upgrade "head"
```

### Reverting migrations

If you want to revert migrations, you should run:
```bash
# revert all migrations up to: revision_id.
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# Revert everything.
 alembic downgrade base
```

### Migration generation

To generate migrations you should run:
```bash
# For automatic change detection.
alembic revision --autogenerate

# For empty file generation.
alembic revision
```


## Running tests

For running tests on your local machine.
1. you need to start a database, ideally with the docker-compose.

2. Run the pytest.
```bash
pytest -vv .
```
