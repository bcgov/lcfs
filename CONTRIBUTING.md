### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for LCFS, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Again, please check the issue tracker before creating enhancement suggestions to see if the feature has already been requested. Fill in the template as completely as possible when listing your suggestion.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain LCFS's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible LCFS
- Enable a sustainable system for LCFS's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
