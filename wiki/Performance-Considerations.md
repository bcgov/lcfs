# Performance Considerations

This document outlines performance considerations for the LCFS system and strategies employed or to be considered for optimization.

## 1. Backend Performance

*   **Framework**: FastAPI is a high-performance Python web framework, built on Starlette and Pydantic, designed for speed and efficiency.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: The backend utilizes `asyncio` with `SQLAlchemy` (via `asyncpg`) and `aio-pika` (for RabbitMQ). This allows for non-blocking I/O operations, significantly improving throughput for I/O-bound tasks by handling many concurrent requests efficiently.
*   **Caching**: Redis is used as a caching layer (via `fastapi-cache2`) to store frequently accessed data and reduce database load. See [Caching Strategy](Caching-Strategy.md) for more details.
*   **Load Testing**: The `backend/performance/` directory contains a `locustfile.py`, indicating that Locust is used for load testing the backend APIs. This helps identify bottlenecks and validate performance under concurrent user load.
    *   **Further Investigation**: Review the `locustfile.py` and associated `readme.md` in `backend/performance/` to understand the specific scenarios tested and performance benchmarks.
*   **Database Optimization**:
    *   **Query Efficiency**: Ensure SQLAlchemy queries are optimized. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for complex queries to understand their execution plans.
    *   **Indexing**: Proper database indexing on frequently queried columns is crucial. This should be reviewed based on query patterns.
    *   **Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy uses connection pooling by default, which is efficient.
*   **Efficient Data Structures**: Using Pydantic for data validation and serialization is generally efficient.

## 2. Frontend Performance

*   **Build Tool**: Vite provides fast cold starts and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development, and optimized builds for production (code splitting, tree shaking, asset optimization).
*   **Component Rendering (React)**:
    *   **Memoization**: Use `React.memo` for functional components and `shouldComponentUpdate` or `PureComponent` for class components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    *   **Virtualization**: For long lists or large tables, consider using windowing libraries (e.g., `react-window` or `react-virtualized`) if AG Grid's built-in virtualization isn't sufficient or applicable elsewhere.
    *   **Lazy Loading**: Use `React.lazy` and Suspense to code-split components and load them on demand, improving initial page load time.
*   **State Management**: Efficient use of Zustand and React Query. React Query helps avoid redundant data fetching and manages server state effectively.
*   **Bundle Size**: Regularly analyze the production bundle size (e.g., using `vite-plugin-inspect` or `rollup-plugin-visualizer`) to identify and optimize large dependencies.
*   **Browser Caching**: Ensure appropriate HTTP caching headers are set for static assets.
*   **Image Optimization**: Serve images in optimized formats (e.g., WebP) and sizes.
*   **Debouncing/Throttling**: For user inputs that trigger expensive operations (e.g., API calls in typeaheads), use debouncing or throttling.

## 3. ETL Performance (Apache NiFi)

*   **Flow Design**: Efficient NiFi flow design is critical. Avoid unnecessary processing, use appropriate processors, and optimize processor configurations.
*   **Back Pressure**: NiFi has built-in back-pressure mechanisms to prevent overwhelming downstream components or systems. Configure these appropriately.
*   **Concurrent Tasks**: Configure the number of concurrent tasks for processors based on available resources and the nature of the task.
*   **Resource Allocation**: Ensure NiFi, Zookeeper, and the source/target databases have adequate CPU, memory, and disk I/O resources.
*   **Batching**: Process data in batches where appropriate to reduce overhead.

## 4. Infrastructure & Network

*   **OpenShift Resource Requests/Limits**: Properly configure CPU and memory requests and limits for pods in OpenShift to ensure stable performance and efficient resource utilization.
*   **Network Latency**: Consider network latency between services, especially between the application and external services like Keycloak or remote databases.
*   **CDN**: For frontend static assets, using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) can significantly improve load times for geographically distributed users (though this depends on the OpenShift setup and if it's fronted by a CDN).

## General Considerations

*   **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring (e.g., using Prometheus, Grafana, or OpenShift's built-in monitoring) to track key performance indicators (KPIs) like response times, error rates, resource utilization, and queue lengths. The presence of `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` in the backend suggests Prometheus metrics are available.
*   **Scalability**: Design components to be scalable, particularly the backend and database, to handle increasing load. OpenShift provides mechanisms for horizontal pod autoscaling.

*Performance is an ongoing concern. Regular testing, monitoring, and profiling are essential to identify and address bottlenecks as the system evolves and load changes.*
