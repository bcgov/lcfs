# Accounting Principles and Standards

## Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)

### Revenue Recognition Principle
Revenue should be recorded when it is earned, regardless of when cash is received. This principle ensures that revenue is matched with the period in which the performance obligation is satisfied.

#### Key Components:
- Identify the contract with the customer
- Identify performance obligations
- Determine transaction price
- Allocate transaction price to performance obligations
- Recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied

### Matching Principle
Expenses should be matched with the revenues they help generate in the same accounting period. This ensures accurate measurement of profitability.

### Cost Principle
Assets should be recorded at their original cost, not current market value. Historical cost provides objectivity and reliability in financial reporting.

### Conservatism Principle
When in doubt, choose the accounting method that least overstates assets and income. This principle requires accountants to exercise caution and prudence.

### Materiality Principle
Items that are significant enough to affect decision-making should be reported separately. Immaterial items may be grouped together or handled using simplified methods.

## International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)

### Framework Concepts
- Relevance: Information must be capable of influencing economic decisions
- Faithful representation: Information must be complete, neutral, and free from error
- Comparability: Information must be comparable across entities and time periods
- Verifiability: Independent observers could reach similar conclusions
- Timeliness: Information must be available when needed
- Understandability: Information must be comprehensible to users

### Key Differences from GAAP
- IFRS allows more judgment and interpretation
- Different inventory valuation methods (LIFO prohibited under IFRS)
- Different approaches to asset revaluation
- More principles-based rather than rules-based

## Fundamental Accounting Equation

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

This equation must always balance and forms the foundation of double-entry bookkeeping.

### Asset Classification
- **Current Assets**: Cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses
- **Non-current Assets**: Property, plant, equipment, intangible assets, long-term investments

### Liability Classification
- **Current Liabilities**: Accounts payable, short-term debt, accrued expenses
- **Long-term Liabilities**: Long-term debt, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities

### Equity Components
- Common stock
- Retained earnings
- Additional paid-in capital
- Accumulated other comprehensive income

## Accrual vs. Cash Accounting

### Accrual Accounting
- Records transactions when they occur, regardless of cash exchange
- Required for public companies
- Provides better matching of revenues and expenses
- More complex but provides accurate financial position

### Cash Accounting
- Records transactions only when cash changes hands
- Simpler to maintain
- Permitted for small businesses
- May not provide accurate picture of financial performance

## Internal Controls and Compliance

### Sarbanes-Oxley Act Requirements
- Management assessment of internal controls
- External auditor attestation
- CEO and CFO certification of financial statements
- Whistleblower protections

### Key Control Activities
- Segregation of duties
- Authorization controls
- Documentation requirements
- Physical safeguards
- Regular reconciliations
- Independent verification
