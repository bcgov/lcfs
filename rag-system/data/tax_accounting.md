# Tax Accounting Principles and Compliance

## Tax vs. Financial Accounting

### Key Differences
- **Purpose**: Tax accounting minimizes taxes; financial accounting provides fair presentation
- **Rules**: Tax follows tax code; financial follows GAAP/IFRS
- **Timing**: Different revenue/expense recognition timing
- **Estimates**: Tax accounting generally prohibits estimates; financial accounting requires them

### Book-Tax Differences
- **Permanent Differences**: Items that affect one system but never the other
- **Temporary Differences**: Items that affect both systems but in different periods

## Corporate Income Tax

### Taxable Income Calculation
**Taxable Income** = Book Income + Book-Tax Adjustments

### Common Book-Tax Adjustments

#### Depreciation Differences
- **Book Depreciation**: Straight-line, useful life estimates
- **Tax Depreciation**: MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System)
- **Section 179 Expensing**: Immediate deduction for qualifying property
- **Bonus Depreciation**: Additional first-year depreciation allowance

#### Revenue Recognition
- **Installment Method**: Available for tax, limited use for books
- **Completed Contract**: Different thresholds for tax vs. books
- **Long-term Contracts**: Percentage of completion required for tax

#### Bad Debt Expenses
- **Book Method**: Allowance method based on estimates
- **Tax Method**: Direct write-off method (specific charge-offs only)

### Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

#### Deferred Tax Assets (DTA)
Arise when tax payments exceed book tax expense:
- Tax loss carryforwards
- Temporary differences that will reduce future tax
- Tax credit carryforwards

**Valuation Allowance**: Reduces DTA when realization is uncertain

#### Deferred Tax Liabilities (DTL)
Arise when book tax expense exceeds tax payments:
- Accelerated tax depreciation
- Temporary differences that will increase future tax

### Tax Provision Process
1. Calculate current tax liability
2. Identify temporary differences
3. Calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities
4. Assess need for valuation allowance
5. Record tax provision journal entry

## Individual Income Tax

### Income Types
- **Ordinary Income**: Wages, interest, business income
- **Capital Gains**: Sale of capital assets
  - Short-term: Held ≤ 1 year, taxed as ordinary income
  - Long-term: Held > 1 year, preferential tax rates

### Deductions
- **Above-the-Line**: Reduce Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
- **Below-the-Line**: Standard deduction or itemized deductions

#### Common Above-the-Line Deductions

### Tax Credits vs. Deductions
- **Tax Credits**: Dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability
- **Tax Deductions**: Reduce taxable income (value = deduction × marginal tax rate)

## State and Local Tax (SALT)
