# Financial Ratios and Analysis

## Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet short-term obligations and convert assets to cash.

### Current Ratio
**Formula**: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
**Interpretation**: 
- Higher ratios indicate better liquidity position
- Generally, 1.5-3.0 considered healthy range
- Too high may indicate inefficient asset utilization
- Industry context crucial for evaluation

**Example**: Current Assets $150,000 ÷ Current Liabilities $100,000 = 1.5

### Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)
**Formula**: (Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) ÷ Current Liabilities
**Purpose**: More conservative liquidity measure excluding less liquid assets
**Interpretation**: 
- Ratio of 1.0 or higher generally considered adequate
- Excludes inventory which may be difficult to convert to cash quickly
- Better measure for companies with slow-moving inventory

### Cash Ratio
**Formula**: (Cash + Short-term Investments) ÷ Current Liabilities
**Purpose**: Most conservative liquidity measure using only most liquid assets
**Use**: Extreme liquidity analysis, crisis situations

### Working Capital
**Formula**: Current Assets - Current Liabilities
**Interpretation**: 
- Positive working capital indicates ability to fund operations
- Amount available for business operations and growth
- Trend analysis more important than absolute amount

## Activity/Efficiency Ratios

These ratios measure how effectively a company utilizes its assets and manages operations.

### Inventory Turnover
**Formula**: Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory
**Days in Inventory**: 365 ÷ Inventory Turnover
**Interpretation**: 
- Higher turnover indicates efficient inventory management
- Lower turnover may indicate obsolete stock or poor sales
- Compare to industry benchmarks and seasonal patterns

### Accounts Receivable Turnover
**Formula**: Net Credit Sales ÷ Average Accounts Receivable  
**Days Sales Outstanding**: 365 ÷ AR Turnover
**Interpretation**:
- Higher turnover indicates efficient collection processes
- DSO should align with stated payment terms
- Increasing DSO may indicate collection problems

### Accounts Payable Turnover
**Formula**: Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Accounts Payable
**Days Payable Outstanding**: 365 ÷ AP Turnover
**Purpose**: Measures payment practices and supplier relationship management

### Asset Turnover
**Formula**: Net Sales ÷ Average Total Assets
**Interpretation**: 
- Measures overall efficiency of asset utilization
- Higher ratios indicate more sales per dollar of assets
- Varies significantly by industry (capital-intensive vs. service)

### Fixed Asset Turnover
**Formula**: Net Sales ÷ Average Net Fixed Assets
**Use**: Measures efficiency of property, plant, and equipment utilization

## Leverage/Solvency Ratios

These ratios assess a company's ability to meet long-term obligations and capital structure decisions.

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
**Formula**: Total Debt ÷ Total Shareholders' Equity
**Interpretation**:
- Higher ratios indicate more financial leverage
- Increases financial risk but may enhance returns
- Industry norms vary widely

### Debt-to-Assets Ratio
**Formula**: Total Debt ÷ Total Assets
**Purpose**: Shows percentage of assets financed by debt
**Range**: 0-1, with higher values indicating more leverage

### Times Interest Earned (Interest Coverage)
**Formula**: EBIT ÷ Interest Expense
**Interpretation**:
- Measures ability to service debt obligations
- Higher ratios indicate greater safety margin
- Generally want ratio above 2.5-3.0

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio
**Formula**: EBITDA ÷ (Interest + Principal Payments)
**Use**: Comprehensive measure of debt service ability including principal repayments

### Equity Multiplier
**Formula**: Total Assets ÷ Total Shareholders' Equity
**Purpose**: Measures financial leverage; component of DuPont analysis

## Profitability Ratios

These ratios evaluate a company's ability to generate profits from operations and investments.

### Gross Profit Margin
**Formula**: (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue
**Interpretation**: 
- Shows markup on products/services
- Higher margins indicate pricing power or cost control
- Compare to industry averages and historical trends

### Operating Profit Margin
**Formula**: Operating Income ÷ Revenue
**Purpose**: Measures profitability from core operations excluding financing and tax effects

### Net Profit Margin  
**Formula**: Net Income ÷ Revenue
**Interpretation**: 
- Bottom-line measure of profitability
- Includes all income statement effects
- Compare trends over time and against competitors

### Return on Assets (ROA)
**Formula**: Net Income ÷ Average Total Assets
**Purpose**: Measures how effectively assets generate profits
**Components**: Can be decomposed into profit margin × asset turnover

### Return on Equity (ROE)
**Formula**: Net Income ÷ Average Shareholders' Equity
**Interpretation**: 
- Measures returns to equity investors
- Key metric for investment decisions
- Should exceed cost of equity capital

### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
**Formula**: NOPAT ÷ (Debt + Equity)
**Where**: NOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Tax
**Use**: Measures returns on all invested capital, useful for comparing companies with different capital structures

## Market Value Ratios

These ratios incorporate market prices and are used primarily for publicly traded companies.

### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)
**Formula**: Market Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share
**Interpretation**:
- Shows how much investors pay per dollar of earnings
- Higher P/E may indicate growth expectations or overvaluation
- Compare to industry and market averages

### Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)
**Formula**: Market Price per Share ÷ Book Value per Share
**Use**: Compares market value to accounting book value
**Below 1.0**: May indicate undervaluation or poor performance

### Dividend Yield
**Formula**: Annual Dividends per Share ÷ Market Price per Share
**Purpose**: Shows dividend return on investment at current price

### Dividend Payout Ratio
**Formula**: Dividends per Share ÷ Earnings per Share
**Interpretation**: Percentage of earnings paid as dividends
**Higher ratios**: Less retention for growth, more current income

### Market-to-Book Ratio
**Formula**: Market Capitalization ÷ Book Value of Equity
**Use**: Overall valuation measure for entire company

## DuPont Analysis

Comprehensive framework breaking down ROE into component drivers:

**Traditional DuPont Formula**:
ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier
ROE = (Net Income ÷ Sales) × (Sales ÷ Assets) × (Assets ÷ Equity)

**Extended DuPont Analysis**:
ROE = (Net Income ÷ EBT) × (EBT ÷ EBIT) × (EBIT ÷ Sales) × (Sales ÷ Assets) × (Assets ÷ Equity)

**Components**:
- Tax efficiency: Net Income ÷ EBT
- Interest burden: EBT ÷ EBIT  
- Operating efficiency: EBIT ÷ Sales
- Asset utilization: Sales ÷ Assets
- Financial leverage: Assets ÷ Equity

## Industry-Specific Ratios

### Banking Industry
- **Net Interest Margin**: Net Interest Income ÷ Average Earning Assets
- **Loan Loss Provision Ratio**: Provision for Loan Losses ÷ Average Loans
- **Efficiency Ratio**: Non-Interest Expense ÷ (Net Interest Income + Non-Interest Income)

### Retail Industry  
- **Same-Store Sales Growth**: Percentage growth in stores open at least one year
- **Sales per Square Foot**: Annual Sales ÷ Retail Floor Space
- **Inventory Shrinkage**: Lost Inventory ÷ Total Inventory

### Manufacturing Industry
- **Capacity Utilization**: Actual Output ÷ Maximum Possible Output
- **Order Backlog**: Unfulfilled Orders ÷ Monthly Sales
- **Scrap Rate**: Defective Units ÷ Total Units Produced

## Ratio Analysis Best Practices

### Comparative Analysis
**Time Series Analysis**: Compare ratios over multiple periods to identify trends
**Cross-Sectional Analysis**: Compare to industry peers and benchmarks
**Combined Approach**: Use both methods for comprehensive evaluation

### Limitations and Considerations
- **Accounting Differences**: Different methods affect comparability
- **Seasonal Variations**: Use appropriate averaging methods
- **One-Time Items**: Adjust for unusual or non-recurring events  
- **Industry Context**: Ratios vary significantly across industries
- **Economic Conditions**: Consider macroeconomic environment

### Ratio Interpretation Framework
1. **Calculate accurately** using consistent data
2. **Compare appropriately** to relevant benchmarks
3. **Consider context** including industry and economic factors
4. **Look for trends** rather than focusing on single period
5. **Investigate anomalies** and understand underlying causes
6. **Use multiple ratios** for comprehensive analysis
