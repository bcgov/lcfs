# Cost Accounting Methods and Applications

## Cost Classification Systems

### By Behavior
- **Variable Costs**: Change proportionally with activity level (direct materials, direct labor)
- **Fixed Costs**: Remain constant regardless of activity level (rent, insurance, depreciation)
- **Mixed Costs**: Contain both fixed and variable components (utilities, telephone)
- **Step Costs**: Fixed within ranges but jump to new levels at certain activity points

### By Traceability
- **Direct Costs**: Easily traceable to cost objects (specific products or services)
- **Indirect Costs**: Cannot be easily traced to specific cost objects (overhead)

### By Function
- **Product Costs**: Costs included in inventory (direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead)
- **Period Costs**: Expensed in the period incurred (selling and administrative expenses)

## Costing Methods

### Job Order Costing
Used when products are manufactured to specific customer orders or in distinct batches.

**Process Flow**:
1. Create job cost sheet for each order
2. Track direct materials used
3. Track direct labor hours and costs
4. Apply manufacturing overhead using predetermined rate
5. Calculate total job cost and unit cost

**Predetermined Overhead Rate** = Estimated Total Manufacturing Overhead ÷ Estimated Activity Base

### Process Costing
Used in continuous production environments where products pass through multiple departments.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Equivalent Units**: Measure of work done, expressed in completed units
- **Cost per Equivalent Unit**: Total costs ÷ Equivalent units produced
- **Transfer Costs**: Costs moved from one department to the next

**Weighted Average Method**:
- Combines beginning inventory costs with current period costs
- Simpler calculation but less precise timing

**FIFO Method**:
- Separates beginning inventory from current production
- More accurate but complex calculations

### Activity-Based Costing (ABC)
Assigns overhead costs based on activities that drive costs rather than volume measures.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Identify activities and their cost drivers
2. Calculate activity rates (Activity Cost ÷ Activity Driver Volume)
3. Assign costs to products based on their consumption of activities

**Benefits**:
- More accurate product costing
- Better understanding of cost behavior
- Improved decision-making for pricing and product mix

**Common Activity Cost Drivers**:
- Machine setups
- Quality inspections  
- Material handling
- Engineering change orders
- Customer orders processed

## Standard Costing and Variance Analysis

### Standard Costs
Predetermined costs that should be achieved under efficient operating conditions.

**Types of Standards**:
- **Ideal Standards**: Perfect conditions, no waste or inefficiencies
- **Practical Standards**: Achievable under normal operating conditions
- **Current Standards**: Based on recent actual performance

### Variance Analysis

#### Material Variances
- **Material Price Variance**: (Actual Price - Standard Price) × Actual Quantity
- **Material Quantity Variance**: (Actual Quantity - Standard Quantity) × Standard Price

#### Labor Variances  
- **Labor Rate Variance**: (Actual Rate - Standard Rate) × Actual Hours
- **Labor Efficiency Variance**: (Actual Hours - Standard Hours) × Standard Rate

#### Overhead Variances
- **Variable Overhead Spending Variance**: Actual VOH - (Actual Hours × Standard Variable Rate)
- **Variable Overhead Efficiency Variance**: (Actual Hours - Standard Hours) × Standard Variable Rate
- **Fixed Overhead Budget Variance**: Actual Fixed OH - Budgeted Fixed OH
- **Fixed Overhead Volume Variance**: Budgeted Fixed OH - Applied Fixed OH

## Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis

### Break-Even Analysis
**Break-Even Point (units)** = Fixed Costs ÷ (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)

**Break-Even Point (dollars)** = Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution Margin Ratio

### Contribution Margin
- **Per Unit**: Selling Price - Variable Cost per Unit
- **Ratio**: Contribution Margin per Unit ÷ Selling Price per Unit
- **Total**: Total Revenue - Total Variable Costs

### Target Profit Analysis
**Required Sales (units)** = (Fixed Costs + Target Profit) ÷ Contribution Margin per Unit

### Margin of Safety
**Margin of Safety** = Actual Sales - Break-Even Sales

**Margin of Safety %** = Margin of Safety ÷ Actual Sales

### Operating Leverage
**Degree of Operating Leverage** = Contribution Margin ÷ Operating Income

Higher operating leverage means greater sensitivity to sales changes.

## Relevant Costing for Decision Making

### Relevant Cost Characteristics
- Future costs that will be incurred
- Costs that differ between alternatives
- Avoidable costs

### Irrelevant Costs
- Sunk costs (already incurred)
- Future costs that are the same for all alternatives
- Allocated common costs

### Decision Types

#### Make vs. Buy Decisions
Compare:
- Direct materials, direct labor, variable overhead (make)
- Purchase price, additional costs (buy)
- Opportunity costs of using facilities

#### Special Order Decisions
Consider:
- Incremental revenue from special order
- Incremental costs (usually variable costs only)
- Available capacity
- Impact on regular sales

#### Product Line Decisions
Evaluate:
- Contribution margin of product line
- Avoidable fixed costs
- Opportunity costs of resources
- Strategic considerations

## Inventory Costing Methods

### FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
- Assumes oldest inventory is sold first
- In rising prices: higher ending inventory, lower COGS, higher profits
- Better matches physical flow for perishable goods

### LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)
- Assumes newest inventory is sold first
- In rising prices: lower ending inventory, higher COGS, lower profits
- Better matches current costs with current revenues
- Not permitted under IFRS

### Weighted Average Cost
- Calculates average cost of all units available for sale
- Smooths out price fluctuations
- Results fall between FIFO and LIFO

### Specific Identification
- Tracks actual cost of each specific unit
- Used for unique, high-value items
- Most accurate but not practical for fungible goods
