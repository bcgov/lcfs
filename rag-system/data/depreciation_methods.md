# Depreciation Methods and Asset Management

## Fundamental Concepts

### Definition and Purpose
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost over its useful life. It serves multiple purposes:
- **Matching Principle**: Matches asset costs with revenues generated
- **Asset Valuation**: Reflects declining value due to use and obsolescence  
- **Tax Benefits**: Provides deductible expenses for tax purposes
- **Financial Analysis**: Supports accurate profitability measurement

### Key Components
- **Cost Basis**: Purchase price plus costs necessary to prepare asset for use
- **Salvage Value**: Estimated residual value at end of useful life
- **Useful Life**: Expected period of economic benefit
- **Depreciable Base**: Cost minus salvage value

## Book Depreciation Methods

### Straight-Line Method
**Formula**: (Cost - Salvage Value) ÷ Useful Life

**Characteristics**:
- Equal expense each period
- Simple to calculate and understand
- Most common method for financial reporting
- Appropriate when asset provides equal benefit each period

**Example**:
- Equipment cost: $100,000
- Salvage value: $10,000  
- Useful life: 9 years
- Annual depreciation: ($100,000 - $10,000) ÷ 9 = $10,000

### Units of Production Method
**Formula**: (Cost - Salvage Value) ÷ Total Expected Units × Actual Units Produced

**Applications**:
- Manufacturing equipment based on machine hours
- Vehicles based on miles driven
- Natural resource extraction
- When usage varies significantly between periods

**Example**:
- Machine cost: $50,000
- Salvage value: $5,000
- Expected production: 100,000 units
- Year 1 production: 15,000 units
- Year 1 depreciation: ($50,000 - $5,000) ÷ 100,000 × 15,000 = $6,750

### Accelerated Depreciation Methods

#### Double-Declining Balance Method
**Formula**: (Book Value at Beginning of Year) × (2 ÷ Useful Life)

**Key Features**:
- Higher depreciation in early years
- Ignores salvage value until final years
- Cannot depreciate below salvage value
- Switch to straight-line when beneficial

**Example** (5-year asset, $10,000 cost, $1,000 salvage):
- Year 1: $10,000 × (2÷5) = $4,000
- Year 2: $6,000 × 40% = $2,400  
- Year 3: $3,600 × 40% = $1,440
- Year 4: $2,160 × 40% = $864 (but limited to reach salvage value)

#### Sum-of-Years'-Digits Method  
**Formula**: (Cost - Salvage Value) × (Remaining Life ÷ Sum of Years)

**Sum of Years Calculation**: n(n+1)÷2, where n = useful life

**Example** (5-year asset):
- Sum of years: 5+4+3+2+1 = 15
- Year 1 fraction: 5/15
- Year 2 fraction: 4/15
- And so forth...

## Tax Depreciation (MACRS)

### Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System
**Key Features**:
- Mandated for most business assets placed in service after 1986
- Predetermined recovery periods regardless of actual useful life
- No salvage value consideration
- Half-year convention for most assets

### MACRS Recovery Periods
- **3-year**: Computer software, tractor units
- **5-year**: Cars, trucks, computers, office equipment
- **7-year**: Office furniture, fixtures, most machinery
- **10-year**: Water transportation equipment
- **15-year**: Land improvements, gas stations  
- **20-year**: Farm buildings (except residences)
- **27.5-year**: Residential rental property
- **39-year**: Commercial real estate

### MACRS Conventions
**Half-Year Convention**: 
- Assumes assets placed in service mid-year
- Half year's depreciation in first and last years

**Mid-Quarter Convention**:
- Applies when >40% of assets placed in service in last quarter
- Uses mid-quarter assumption for all assets that year

### Section 179 Expensing
**Features**:
- Immediate expensing up to annual limit ($1,160,000 for 2023)
- Phase-out begins at $2,890,000 total purchases
- Limited to taxable income from active business
- Primarily for small and medium-sized businesses

### Bonus Depreciation
**Current Rules**:
- 80% bonus depreciation for 2023 (phasing down)
- Applies to new and certain used assets
- No dollar limits like Section 179
- Available for assets with recovery periods of 20 years or less

## Special Depreciation Considerations

### Asset Improvements vs. Repairs
**Capital Improvements** (Depreciate):
- Extend useful life significantly
- Increase asset capacity or efficiency
- Add new functionality
- Major renovations or overhauls

**Repairs and Maintenance** (Expense immediately):
- Restore asset to normal operating condition
- Regular upkeep and minor replacements
- Don't significantly extend useful life
- Routine maintenance activities

### Group Depreciation
**Composite Method**:
- Groups similar assets with different lives
- Uses weighted average life for all assets
- No gain/loss recognized on individual disposals
- Simplifies record-keeping for numerous small assets

### Component Depreciation
**Application**:
- Required under IFRS for significant components
- Separate depreciation for parts with different useful lives
- Common for buildings (structure, roof, HVAC)
- More accurate matching of costs and benefits

## Impairment and Disposal

### Asset Impairment Testing
**Indicators of Impairment**:
- Significant market value decline
- Changes in asset use or condition
- Adverse business or regulatory changes
- Poor economic performance

**Impairment Loss Calculation**:
- Book value exceeds recoverable amount
- Recoverable amount = higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use
- Recognize impairment loss immediately

### Asset Disposal
**Gain/Loss Calculation**:
- **Gain**: Proceeds > Net Book Value
- **Loss**: Proceeds < Net Book Value
- **Net Book Value**: Original cost less accumulated depreciation

## Depreciation Policy Development

### Establishing Useful Lives
**Factors to Consider**:
- Physical wear and tear expectations
- Technological obsolescence rate
- Economic factors and market conditions
- Company's historical experience
- Industry benchmarks

### Policy Documentation
**Required Elements**:
- Capitalization thresholds
- Depreciation methods by asset class
- Useful life schedules
- Impairment testing procedures
- Disposal and retirement processes

## Financial Analysis Impact

### Key Ratios Affected
**Asset Turnover**: Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets
- Higher depreciation reduces asset base
- May improve turnover ratios

**Return on Assets**: Net Income ÷ Average Total Assets  
- Depreciation expense reduces net income
- Lower asset base from accumulated depreciation

**Debt-to-Equity**: Total Debt ÷ Total Equity
- Depreciation reduces retained earnings
- May increase leverage ratios over time

### Cash Flow Considerations
**Non-Cash Expense**:
- Depreciation doesn't require cash outflow
- Important adjustment in cash flow analysis
- Tax depreciation provides actual cash savings

**Capital Expenditure Planning**:
- Depreciation helps estimate replacement needs
- Useful for budgeting and forecasting
- Supports asset renewal strategies

## International Considerations

### IFRS vs. GAAP Differences
**Revaluation Model** (IFRS only):
- Assets may be carried at fair value
- Revaluation gains to other comprehensive income
- Depreciation based on revalued amounts

**Component Depreciation**:
- Required under IFRS for significant parts
- Optional under U.S. GAAP
- More detailed tracking and calculation

**Impairment Reversal**:
- Permitted under IFRS (except goodwill)
- Prohibited under U.S. GAAP
- Different approaches to value recovery
