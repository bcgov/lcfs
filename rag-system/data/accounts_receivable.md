Accounts receivable represents money owed by customers for goods delivered or services performed on credit. Effective AR management is crucial for:
- Maintaining healthy cash flow
- Minimizing bad debt losses
- Optimizing working capital
- Building customer relationships

## AR Process Flow

### 1. Credit Assessment and Approval
**Credit Policy Components**:
- Credit application requirements
- Credit scoring models
- Credit limits based on financial analysis
- Terms and conditions (payment periods, discounts)
- Approval authority levels

**Credit Analysis Factors**:
- Financial statements review
- Credit bureau reports
- Trade references
- Industry and economic conditions
- Payment history with company

### 2. Order Processing and Invoicing
**Best Practices**:
- Verify customer information and shipping address
- Confirm pricing and terms match approved credit
- Generate accurate, detailed invoices promptly
- Include clear payment terms and contact information
- Send invoices through preferred customer channels

### 3. Collections Management
**Collection Strategy Timeline**:
- **0-30 days**: Automated payment reminders
- **31-60 days**: Personal contact, payment plans
- **61-90 days**: Management involvement, escalation
- **90+ days**: Collection agency or legal action

## Aging Analysis and Reporting

### Standard Aging Categories
- **Current (0-30 days)**: Recently issued invoices within terms
- **31-60 days**: Overdue but often collectible
- **61-90 days**: Significant collection concerns
- **Over 90 days**: High risk of uncollectibility

### Key Performance Indicators

#### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
**Formula**: (Accounts Receivable ÷ Daily Credit Sales)
- **Benchmark**: Compare to industry standards and payment terms
- **Trend Analysis**: Monitor monthly changes
- **Target**: Generally 10-15 days beyond payment terms

#### Collection Effectiveness Index (CEI)
**Formula**: (Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Ending AR) ÷ (Beginning AR + Credit Sales - Ending Current AR) × 100
- Measures effectiveness of collection efforts
- Higher percentages indicate better performance

#### Bad Debt Percentage
**Formula**: Bad Debt Expense ÷ Net Credit Sales
- Industry benchmarks vary widely
- Track trends to identify process improvements

#### AR Turnover Ratio
**Formula**: Net Credit Sales ÷ Average Accounts Receivable
- Higher ratios indicate faster collection
- Compare to industry standards

## Credit Management Policies

### Payment Terms Options
- **Net 30**: Payment due within 30 days
- **2/10 Net 30**: 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise net 30
- **COD (Cash on Delivery)**: Payment required upon delivery
- **CIA (Cash in Advance)**: Payment before shipment
- **Letters of Credit**: Bank guarantees for international transactions

### Credit Limits and Reviews
**Setting Credit Limits**:

- Multiple of monthly purchase volume
- Based on payment capacity analysis
- Consider industry risk factors

**Regular Review Process**:
- Annual comprehensive reviews
- Triggered reviews for payment delays
- Credit limit increases with business growth

## Collection Strategies and Techniques

- Payment agreements and arrangements
- Documentation for potential legal action
- Certified mail for important notices

### Special Situations
**Payment Plans**:

- Monitor compliance closely
- Consider partial payments to show good faith

**Disputes and Deductions**:
- Investigate validity promptly
- Separate disputed from undisputed amounts
- Resolve underlying issues
- Document resolution agreements

## Bad Debt Management

### Recognition Methods
**Allowance Method (GAAP required)**:
- Estimate uncollectible amounts
- Create contra-asset account (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts)
- Adjust estimate periodically based on experience

**Direct Write-off Method**:
- Recognize bad debt when specific account deemed uncollectible
- Simple but doesn't match expenses with revenues
- Acceptable for tax purposes

### Allowance Estimation Techniques
**Percentage of Sales Method**:
- Apply historical bad debt percentage to current sales
- Simple but may not reflect current conditions

**Aging Method**:
- Apply different percentages to each aging category
- More accurate reflection of collection risk
- Requires detailed aging analysis

**Individual Account Analysis**:
- Assess each account's collectibility
- Most accurate but time-intensive
- Used for large or unusual accounts
