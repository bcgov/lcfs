## Test Instructions

1. **Run each valid query (1-25)** and verify:
   - Query is accepted (not filtered out)
   - Answer is relevant to the question
   - Context documents are retrieved (num_documents_reranked > 0)
   - Answer quality matches expected content

2. **Run each invalid query (26-40)** and verify:
   - Query is rejected with domain restriction message
   - `filtered_out: true` in response
   - No documents retrieved (all retrieval counts = 0)

3. **Run edge cases (41-46)** and document:
   - Whether query is accepted or rejected
   - Quality of response if accepted
   - Consider if filtering behavior is appropriate

## Success Criteria

- **Valid queries**: â‰¥90% should be accepted with relevant answers
- **Invalid queries**: 100% should be filtered out with consistent rejection message
- **Retrieval metrics**: Valid queries should show document retrieval (BM25 > 0, Embedding > 0)
- **Answer quality**: Responses should be factually correct based on knowledge base content
- **Consistency**: Same query should produce same filtering decision every time

## Notes

- Focus on accuracy of domain filtering first, then answer quality
- Document any queries where filtering behavior seems incorrect
- Note any accounting questions that are incorrectly filtered out
- Track response times for performance evaluation
